/* AI TRANSPARANCY.
What AI helped me with:
- Animations
- Padding, Display:flex, font-family, margin (because I didn't know what they were and how they worked)
- Background colors: 1. I'm not creative in colors, 2. Linear-gradient is difficult for me.
- Cursor:pointer (I forgot... but we saw it in class during the html recap).

    /* I know now however what the "deg" means:
    - 0deg = 0°: top to bottom
    - 90 deg = 90°: left to right
    - 180 deg = 180°: bottom to top
    etc.
    
    So at least ai thought me something.*/
